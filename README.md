### Usage
##### Benchmarking
<pre><code># compile the C++ driver
cd mongo-cxx-driver && scons 
# compile the benchmark script
scons benchmark 

To run on an already existing mongod:

	(start mongod on 27017 to test against and record 
	the results into)

	# this runs the tests and records the results
	# optionally supply a label as well using -l
	python local.py --nolaunch -l HOSTNAME

To run it against the source on github:
	
	# this pulls and starts mongod from the github repo,
	# runs the tests and records the results
	# optionally supply a label as well using -l
	python local.py -l HOSTNAME

# this serves the results on port 80
# sudo if you're not root
python server.py 

Go to http://localhost to see the results
</code></pre>

##### Analysis

Use `alerting.ini` and `reporting.ini` as a starting point to describe the kinds of alerts or reports you would like to generate. 

`analysismgr.py` defines pipelines - ALERT_TASKS and REPORT_TASKS - which control the flow of data processing. Definitions for alerts/reports are described in `alert_definitions.ini` and `report_definitions.ini` - you can define as many alerts/reports as you wish. All fields described and enumerated in the sample '.ini' files are **required**.

**Note that you need at least three days' worth of data to run* `analysismgr.py`.
<pre><code># this runs the whole pipeline of analysis and reporting
python analysismgr.py</code></pre>
Logs are written to stdout and 'mongo-perf-log.txt' when you run `analysismgr.py`

##### Reporting
The default pipeline for both alerts and reports (as listed in ALERT_TASKS and REPORT_TASKS) show the result of the alerts/reports processing using your default web browser.

If you wish to receive email reports, change the last stage in pipeline in `analysismgr.py` to 'show report' for reports, and 'send alerts' for alerts. By default, emails are sent using Amazon SES Â® so you will need an account on that to send email reports.
