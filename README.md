TODO:
- convert the old c++ tests in needs_conversion to js tests in benchrun
- make sure that the gui server.py has the data it needs to generate graphs
-- ensure we're saving the results to the right place.
-- this will probably happen when we rewrite lib_report.js to be part of the marathon/warmup framework.
- update readmes and requirements appropriately.
