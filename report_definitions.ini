; homogeneity determines our threshold on the 
; tendency of similarity in time series behaviour
; A higher value captures only outliers in a very
; uniform metric's series'. A value of 0 captures 
; all outliers - regardless of the metric's similarity
; The values range from [0 - 100]
~homogeneity= 50
; Threshold is a measure of the deviation of the outlier.
; From experience, if threshold > 1.5 then there's probably
; a significant outlier for the current day - the sensitivity
; is greater for the previous day.
; We only report on values greater than the given threshold
~threshold= 1.5
