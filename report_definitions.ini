; homogeneity determines our threshold on the 
; tendency of similarity in time series behaviour (per thread)
; A lower value captures only outliers in a very
; uniform series (per metric, per test, per thread). 
; A value of 100 captures all outliers - regardless 
; of similarity
; The values range from [0 - 100]

; Threshold is a measure of the deviation of the outlier.
; From experience, if threshold > 1.5 then there's probably
; a significant outlier for the current day - the sensitivity
; is greater for the previous day.
; We only report on values greater than the given threshold
; The values range from [0 - âˆž]
